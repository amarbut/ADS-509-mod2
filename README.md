# Text Cleaning and Exploration
Once you have collected a text dataset, there are several common ways to prepare that dataset and perform exploratory analysis. In this assignment, you will use the HackerNews dataset created in the Module 1 assignment to:
- Clean, normalize, and tokenize text
- Explore and analyze text
- Vectorize text
- Perform basic sentiment analysis

## Instructions

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod2](https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod2). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructor’s GitHub account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Follow the provided Jupyter Notebook like a worksheet, completing all of the **TODO** items in the provided code cells and answering all of the written questions (marked **Q**) in the provided markdown cells. DO NOT create your own notebook or .py file from scratch, as this inevitably leads to missed instructions or questions and complicates grading.
3. When you have finished your code, print your notebook as a PDF and submit it in Canvas. 
4. Commit your code, push the changes to GitHub, and include a link to your repo in your Canvas submission note so your instructor has access to the .ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
