I like Zed in the architectural and foundational aspects.  
I want more tools like Zed to exist. But, I find Zed challenging to adopt due to random nuances. First, settings management is a mixed bag and sometimes I just want a quick way to open the ""settings.json"" from the settings pane without fussing around. Then I'd like the ""settings.json"" to stay open (reopen) on a restart of Zed.  Then I'd like the ability to use an LLM that doesn't have native tool calling support, which Zed seems to be the only app I've used that doesn't have a workaround. Then I'd like the UI to be a little easier to navigate as a new user, it feels a bit scattered and overwhelming at times. I haven't used Zed much and I may give it another shot (soon), but it very much feels like a tool built by engineers for engineers... Which is great for power users, but seems not so great for new adopters. I don't think the shortcomings are a blocker, but they are the reason I haven't adopted Zed.

There are a lot of comments that people need X feature in order to switch to Y editor. While that may be true and your particular workflow requires certain features, what is overlooked is the survival pressure for editors. It appears that our industry is moving towards adoption, sometimes mandatory, of AI coding agents. Regardless of your feelings on the topic, having good tooling to support this effort comes down to: switching costs, compatibility with existing editors, and a strong ecosystem of third party extensions. While Cursor/Windsurf jumped the gun on bespoke editor integrations with LLMs - the adoption of MCP and other SDKs for coding agents means it's plug and play. The full feature set will be in every editor connected to every agent. I think Zed wins on having the lowest switching costs for most developers. Paying down generic solutions like Agent Client Protocol (AC) now is a good  strategy. It took multiple parties coming together for us to get TLS, OAuth 2.0, and ECMAScript. I don't see why most editors should behave like hand crafted musical instruments when in reality they are much more akin to high quality knives in a kitchen (sure you have your favorite knife set and bring it from job to job, but at the end of the day you can be just as productive with a different knife when necessary). reply",Claude Code: Now in Beta in Zed,meetpateltech,2025-09-03 15:07:20,https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp,249,183

45116688,45118684,Karrot_Kream,42 minutes ago,"I wanted to like VSCode but it has enough input latency on my machines that it's not that enjoyable when I'm ""locked in"". Also if I'm running a bunch of services in Docker on MacOS (which means they're running VMs sigh) the overhead of VSCode is just too much and the system starts swapping constantly grinding the whole thing to a halt. I also find configuring it a pain. Every configuration pane feels ad-hoc and not part of a holistic, configurable system. Emacs has lots of crusty bits and an annoying event loop that you have to really work around but is designed a lot more holistically than VSCode. Zed to me feels like a great batteries-included editor and I still run it as my non-emacs alternate editor. I wish its configuration was a bit more discoverable (especially with configuring linters/formatters), but it's 95% of what I need 95% of the time. reply",Claude Code: Now in Beta in Zed,meetpateltech,2025-09-03 15:07:20,https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp,249,183

And there are others that try every new mousetrap that hits the market. (and that's ok, not slighting either one) I will say that I personally have never really gelled with VSCode no matter how much I try to customize it, it still is just a bit off. For me, it's like it's too much to be a simple editor like SublimeText or NeoVim, but not quite enough to be an IDE like IntelliJ or Visual Studio (full). It does just enough that I expect a bit more of it and it often fails to deliver. Right now I tend to just use 2 editors - one very simple one for viewing/editing text files and one IDE (currently IntelliJ) for coding in a project. On topic - Zed is actually a really nice editor.

I decided to give Doom Emacs a try. Well, I like the keybindings so far. However, it got issues. When I use neotree, it gets confused with windows (the Emacs term ""window"", not desktop windows, or the OS). Also it has already crashed twice. Once I even lost some code, which I had to write again. Unacceptable. Why was there not even an Emacs backup file for the file I was editing? Anyway, today I thought: ""Why not try one of these other editors in that VM and see, if I like any?"" Yesterday I looked again at LunarVim's website. While LunarVim seems to look pretty, it has a lot of dependencies, including pip, npm, and more. Seems like it is installing stuff from everywhere. Not so confidence inspiring, especially pip and npm installs. And just now I see this Zed blog post linked on HN! But, unfortunately the website is not inspiring much confidence either. Can anyone explain to me, why I cannot see any _text_ on all of zed.dev, without running JS? I mean, I probably know the answer, or some possible answers, but man, that's already such a turnoff, I already doubt the editor is any good now.

I haven't used emacs on Windows natively in a long time but I did it for years and found it worked quite well so you may want to try that again. FWIW emacs these days has native LSP support (eglot) and native tree-sitter supported, but you'll need to grab tree-sitter libraries and LSP servers. For MacOS I found just using brew to install most of these works great, and I wonder if Windows can't work the same way. If you're in a VM you should just be able to have your package manager do the work. LLM support in emacs is still a bit primitive but there are packages like emacs claude-code that are changing things. Personally I wrote an elisp function which grabs the filename of the emacs window relative to the project root and copies it so that I can just paste it into claude code and have it ask questions or do things. ``` (defun copy-buffer-file-name-from-project-root ()
  ""Copy the relative path of the buffer in this project to the kill ring""
  (interactive)
  (kill-new (file-relative-name (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)) (project-root (project-current))))) ``` if you're curious but depending on how you have your clipboards setup with the kill ring, you may need to modify this. --- As far as fighting the JS fight on the Zed website, well, I think this thread isn't one of those upvote-anti-JS-rant threads that spring up on this site all the time so shrug. reply",Claude Code: Now in Beta in Zed,meetpateltech,2025-09-03 15:07:20,https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp,249,183

That means what I'm mostly doing is keeping Claude Code up in the terminal and having it do things. Claude Code has an option to view diffs in your editor which you can configure and works fine with emacs and its various diff modes (and looks great too.) I usually always make sure everything in my branch is committed before letting Claude Code loose on my code so I can view the changes normally as a magit diff and then choose whether I want to edit any of its changes (90% of the time) or commit as is (10% of the time.) I can also restore files selectively this way and have all of my git tools available if needed. If you want deep Claude Code integration Cursor style, then check out https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el . The latest releases of emacs support using `vc` blocks to specify packages so you can grab the elisp package straight from the repo and get it working within your emacs.

Domestically, I wouldnt be surprised if all of this data from US owned VPNs is shipped to the NSA or other groups and analyzed. After the Snowden reveals its hard to really see this stuff as conspiracy anymore. Weird technical issues happen because a lot of services don't keep vpn's in mind. I saw a lot of people were having issues connecting to multiplayer game servers. The vpn provider broke something, maybe it was on a blacklisted IP, maybe increased latency, maybe the IP is in the wrong region and people are connecting to a NA server but are in LATAM, etc. I really dont know the use case for a vpn, not to mention advertising snooping happens on the application level anyway. Its javascript running on my browser and html5 and heaven knows what else analyzing me for ads, not ""what IP did you connect from."" Lastly, there are privacy tools like onion and running a browser with no js active. These vpn types dont do that. They're actually not getting the privacy and security they want because tor is slow and a no-js firefox is unfun.

Usually the interface they provide to the customer is just a normal SaaS “pay us money and give us a list of URLs and we will give you the page content”, and the interface they provide to the end user is a game or marginally useful utility, and nobody but the company realizes they’re doing something dodgy. reply","Who Owns, Operates, and Develops Your VPN Matters",sdsantos,2025-09-03 16:51:05,https://www.opentech.fund/news/who-owns-operates-and-develops-your-vpn-matters-an-analysis-of-transparency-vs-anonymity-in-the-vpn-ecosystem-and-implications-for-users/,84,58

It should also mean users not having to inherently trust corporations. VPN providers all run the same two or three VPN protocols, all with similar security guarantees and privacy limitations. I've been playing with MASQUE relays over the last year. Apple's iCloud Private Relay is a MASQUE relay (two, actually). MASQUE can offer genuine privacy improvements via traffic separation, preventing any single party from correlating the traffic source and destination. Some of the privacy concerns of VPN users can be mitigated with better technology. And relays are built into Apple operating systems today.

Someone else mentioned in this thread that you cannot add annotations to the text to control the output. I think for these models to really level up there will have to be an intermediate step that takes your regular text as input and it generates an annotated output, which can be passed to the TTS model.

Traditional non-ML TTS for longer content like podcasts or audiobooks seems like it'd become grating to the point of being unlistenable, or at least a significantly worse experience. Stands to benefit from more natural sounding voices that can place emphasis in the right places. Since Stephen Hawking was brought up, there are likely also people with voice-impairing illnesses who would like to speak in their own voice again (in addition to those who are fine with a robotic voice). Or alternatively, people who are uncomfortable with their natural voice and want to communicate closer to how they wish to be perceived.

My second piece of data is from flyover video (areas of interest where water is also clear enough to see the bottom). With enough video I can mostly remove the water-borne artifacts (ripples, reflections etc) and enhance the river bottom imagery enough to attempt photogrammetric reconstruction. The bottleneck here is that it takes multiple angles to do that, and the visibility through water is highly dependent on the angle of sunlight vs angle of camera. Instead of doing multiple flyovers at different times of day to try and get enough angles for a mesh reconstruction, maybe this can do it relatively well from one angle! reply",Voyager – An interactive video generation model with realtime 3D reconstruction,mingtianzhang,2025-09-03 11:07:16,https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-Voyager,262,181

Better to be more cautious with AI too so we can prevent negative societal effects rather than trying to roll them back when billions of euros are already at play, and thus the corporate lobby and interests in keeping things as they are. We didn't regulate social media algorithms which started optimising for hate (as it's the best means of ""engagement"") and it led to polarisation in society, the worst effects of which can be seen in the US itself. The country is tearing itself apart. And we see the effects in Europe too. Again, something we should have nipped in the bud. And the problem isn't mainly the tech.

Are there methods that specifically apply this idea? I guess this is a good explanation for why deep learning isn't just automatically impossible, because if local minima were everywhere then it would be impossible. But on the other hand, usually the goal isn't to add more and more parameters, it's to add just enough so that common features can be identified but not enough to ""memorize the dataset."" And to design an architecture that is flexible enough but is still quite restricted, and can't represent any function. And of course in many cases (especially when there's less data) it makes sense to manually design transformations from the high dimensional space to a lower dimensional one that contains less noise and can be modeled more easily. The article feels connected to the manifold hypothesis, where the function we're modeling has some projection into a low dimensional space, making it possible to model. I could imagine a similar thing where if a potential function has lots of ridges, you can ""glue it together"" so all the level sets line up, and that corresponds with some lower dimensional optimization problem that's easier to solve.

What we keep hearing from IT teams is: - Integration tax: Each module still lives in its own data model. Schools end up exporting CSVs or building Mule pipelines to reconcile SIS+LMS+CRM. Our agent sits on top of all sources with pre-built connectors and a unified schema, so coaches see enrollment + Canvas grades + attendance in one call (like in the Triage Center)
- Operational burden: Products like Data Cloud or Agentforce are powerful but need admin capacity that smaller schools just don’t have. We ship a default ruleset for advisors + prompt library so an advisor can be productive immediately.
- Cost creep: Several platforms meter GPT usage or require new AI  licenses. We price per active student so budgeting is predictable, which is a big plus for universities and their unique budget cycles.

45115004,45116838,rectang,3 hours ago,"A few months ago, I was studying Giant Steps and I came across the “Giant Steps is actually very simple (yes, really)” video by Dave Pollack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd75Mwo4JNo Pollack argues that the main reason that Giant Steps is such a high mountain is because it is traditionally played at such a ferocious tempo. Slow it down, and the Coltrane Changes become fairly ordinary ii-V-I substitution progressions. I’m persuaded. I love Coltrane, and I’ve listened to the Giant Steps album countless times. The Coltrane Changes are very nice, but in the line of other jazz theory such as tritone substitution, the deceptive cadence, and so on. The main thing with Giant Steps is that to play it like Coltrane does you have to practice it to death, accumulate a vocabulary of riffs, and gain facility at improvising over sophisticated changes moving at a speed that other tunes won’t have prepared you for.

45079767,45117116,taeric,2 hours ago,"Fun read.  My take on the ""special something"" that causes people to care about implementation is that you want to specifically control parts of a computer.  Yes, this is typically for run-time performance; but crucially it is because you want to specifically reason about what the computer will be doing to implement your program.  And the more that your computer is capable of doing, the more you are likely to care about different aspects of how it executes. I'd hazard this goes both ways, too.  That is, it is not just in terms of how much the computer is capable of doing, but what the real world systems being modeled can do.  For a fun example, you can make a sorting network that can sort integers on a computer rapidly, but that doesn't necessarily help you sort a physical quantity of anything.  Is akin to making a computer that can win a game of chess, but only if the human moves the pieces for it. All too often, people present programs as if they are truths independent of either model or computer.  Which is doubly wrong as they are constrained by the model of the language they are implemented in, as well as being dependent on the model of whatever problem they are describing. reply",Abstract Machine Models Also: what Rust got particularly right,mustache_kimono,2025-08-31 02:20:10,https://dr-knz.net/abstract-machine-models.html,64,4

It _might_ help if you write a script, and have someone go through and mark anything off topic. Even if you don't use the script on stage, writing it and having it might anchor you to the topic at hand. This one depends.  I agree with you probably 4 out of 5 times it happens, but that other 20% are probably some of the best, most memorable talks. reply",How to Give a Good Talk,pykello,2025-08-30 18:42:08,https://blog.sigplan.org/2025/03/31/how-to-give-a-good-talk/,158,58

A lot of jokes rely on things like shared background/experience/cultural touchstones, so tricky to do in a conference where you might not know those things about your audience.

But in energy markets and system ops, classification is less about first principles and more about how resources interact with the grid. That’s why most ISOs/TSOs register a battery as both a load and a generator, it consumes on charge and supplies on discharge. So when people talk about the “generation mix,” batteries get bucketed alongside gas, wind, solar, etc. Not because they magically create energy, but because from the grid operator’s perspective they look like a dispatchable generator when discharging.

Basically, be reasonable. Note for others that it’s actually very difficult to accurately take a photo of the glow. They are overall quite “dim”, requiring near total darkness and eyes adapted to darkness for a bit to see.  Unfortunately, if you expect what you see in the marketing materials, you’ll be disappointed. Cameras tend to either be unable to see the glow, or blow it way out of proportion. They are quite a bit above your typical glowing fungus though. They can also be kinda finicky to grow until you learn what they need. Basically: -Full sun. Internode length directly correlates with light received. I can make them “leggy” or ultra dense with my adjustable lights. -Prefer cooler temperatures. They don’t seem to like high 80’s to 90’s. Seem to prefer 60-70 degrees F -They happily survive the winter while inside, and can survive multiple years. Temps below 40F will cause them to start shutting down, with freezing/frost having a good chance to kill them. -Need well drained soil. Straight potting soil will hold too much moisture for too long, causing root rot. -Prefer bigger and deeper pots, like 10+”. I’d consider 6” the minimum -Like being spoon fed fertilizer with waterings. Jack’s petunia feed is perfect. -May be slightly sensitive to chlorine/chloramine in tap water. I suspect it contributes to some curious yellowing on the leaves. A bit of API stress coat takes care of that. This is good for other house plants as well. -Sometimes the leaves will have curious yellowing (yellow veins, leaf tips) no matter what you do. It may just be how it is. -Can be prone to fasciation (mutant flowers or stalks) -When outside, can get bud worms that chew the flowers, leaves, or developing seed pods -Fungus gnats can be an issue, especially when propagating cuttings. -Susceptible to downy mildew (seen mostly in late summer/fall) -They respond well to being chopped back every so often. I’ll occasionally remove 1/3rd to 2/3rds of their top mass. This also has the benefit of removing weight from the initially thin and weak stems (which thicken over time). -Can be crossed with other petunias, and sometimes even tobacco. Note that pigments in the flowers from other petunia varieties block the glow, so they’ll be dimmer. -Wild petunias (or whatever the ancestor plants are) rely on moths for pollination. You can get lots of seeds by manually pollinating the flowers. -They tend to emit more fragrance at night (for attracting moths) -The newest growth is the brightest, in particular the recently developed flowers that haven’t opened yet which truly look “glowing”. Normally the glow of most of the plant, is comparable to taking it outside into moonlight. The brightness will shift from day to day as well. Sometimes it’ll be much dimmer or brighter than normal. reddit.com/r/FireflyPetunia/ If you want “cool glowing thing” but something less intensive, and momentarily much brighter, you may look into getting a glowing algae kit, like pyrofarms.com/ reply",Glow-in-the-dark houseplants shine in rainbow of colours,bookofjoe,2025-08-31 13:34:36,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02740-2,37,38

reading context: variations of light and viewing angle, high cognitive load for the pilot etc� So, B612 has created a concept of increased legibility of shape for
less ideal situations and associated methods of mark corrections,
to optimise the final rendering of the text and on-screen reading,
particularly with the use of incises and ‘light-traps’ . An incise is a small serif which interrupts the regularity of the
vertical line: here it allows to accentuate the clarity of the leading
stroke (top part) of the vertical stem 8 to avoid it being rounded
off when antialiasing. The principle of ‘ink traps’ has existed as long as typography has: it
is a small indentation at the junction of letter strokes which ‘traps’
the ink on small characters, so that it doesn't block the junction and
affect the legibility. In the case of B612, the ‘light traps’ accentuate
the counterforms 7, particularly for the sharp angles� The indenta-

C genuinely is easy to pick up.  It is harder to master.  And you're right, for many domains, there are better options now, so it may not be worth while mastering it. Because it's an old language, what it lacks in built-in safety features, is provided by decades of very good surrounding tooling.  You do of course need to learn that tooling, and choose to use it! In the context of Magic Lantern, C is the natural fit.  We are working with very tight memory limitations, due to the OS.  We support single core 200Mhz targets (ARMv5, no out-of-order or other fancy tricks).  We don't include C stdlib, a small test binary can be < 1kB.  Normal builds are around 400kB (this includes a full GUI, debug capabilities, all strings and assets, etc). Canon code is probably mostly C, some C++.  We have to call their code directly (casting reverse engineered addresses to function pointers, basically).  We don't know what safety guarantees their code makes, or what the API is.

Starting with good code examples means you are much less likely to trigger it. Having a good, logical description of supported features, with a warning that if you do unsupported stuff things may break, is much more important than trying to define every possible action in a predictable way. The latter approach often leads to explosion of spec volume and gives way more opportunities for writing bad code: predictable in execution, but instead with problems in design and logic which are harder to understand, maintain and fix.

45078315,45117196,names_r_hard,2 hours ago,"5D3 is perhaps the best currently supported ML cam for video.  It's very capable - good choice.  Using both CF and SD cards simultaneously, it can record at about 145MB/s, so you can get very high quality footage. Re what we can support - it's a reverse engineering project, we can support anything with enough time ;)  The very newest cams have software changes that make enabling ML slightly harder for normal users, but don't make much difference from a developer perspective.  I don't see any signs of Canon trying to lock out reverse engineers.  Gaining access and doing a basic, ML GUI but no features port, is not hard when you have experience. What we choose to support: I work on the cams that I have.  And the cams that I have are whatever I find for cheap, so it's pretty random.  Other devs have whatever priorities they have :) The first cam I ported to was 200D, unsupported at the time.  This took me a few months to get ML GUI working (with no features enabled), and I had significant help.  Now I can get a new cam to that standard in a few days in most cases.  All the cams are fairly similar for the core OS.  It's the peripherals that change the most as hardware improves, so this takes the most time.  And the newer the camera, the more the hw and sw has diverged from the best supported cams. The cheapest way for you to get started is to use your 5D3 - which you can do in our fork of qemu.  You can dump the roms (using software, no disassembly required), then emulate a full Canon and ML GUI, which can run your custom ML changes.  There are limitations, mostly around emulation of peripherals.  It's still very useful if you want to improve / customise the UI. https://github.com/reticulatedpines/qemu-eos/tree/qemu-eos-v... Re docs - they're not in a great shape.  It's scattered over a few different wikis, a forum, and commit messages in multiple repos.  Quick discussion happens on Discord.  We're very responsive there, it's the best place for dev questions.  The forum is the best single source for reference knowledge.  From a developer perspective, I have made some efforts on a Dev Guide, but it's far from complete, e.g.: https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/...

45078315,45118849,fooker,25 minutes ago,"> turn the cam itself into a star tracker Hmm, that's a neat idea. The better language for it is 'auto guider'. Auto guiding is basically supplying correction information to the mount when it drifts off. Most mounts support guiding input and virtually all astrophotographers set up a separate tiny camera, a small scope, and a laptop to auto guide the mount. It would be neat for the main camera to do it. The caveat is that this live view sampling would add extra noise to the main images (more heat, etc). But in my opinion, the huge boost in convenience would make that worth it, given that modern post processing is pretty good for mitigating noise. The signals that have to be sent to the mount are pretty simple too, so I'll look at this at some point in future. The bottleneck for me is that I have ever got 'real' auto guiding to work reliably with my mount so if I run into issues it would be tricky as there's no baseline working version. > Maybe an auto image upload service? This sounds pretty useful, even uploading seamlessly to a phone or laptop would be a huge time saver for most people!

I have done a stint in QA, as well as highly aggressive security testing against a big C codebase, so I too care a lot about quality.  And you can do it in C, you just have to put in the effort. I'd like to get Valgrind or ASAN working with our code, but that's quite a big task on an RTOS.  It would be more practical in Qemu, but still a lot of effort.  The OS has multiple allocators, and we don't include stdlib. Re firmware / software, doesn't all software run on a device?  So I suppose it depends what you mean by a device.  Is a Windows exe on a desktop PC firmware?  Is an app from your phones store firmware?  We support cams that are much more powerful than low end Android devices.  Here the cam OS, which is on flash ROM, brings the hardware up, then loads our code from removable storage, which can even be a spinning rust drive.  It feels like they're firmware, and we're software, to me.  It's not a clearly defined term. The main reason I make the distinction is because we get a lot of users who think ML is like a phone rom flash, because that's what firmware is to most people.  Thus they assume it's a risky process, and that the Canon menus etc will be gone.

The manufacturers don't provide many guarantees, it's just up to you and downstream software to figure out what looks good.
Funny that so much thought goes into designing the feel of a camera yet the photo output is basically undefined...

45078315,45115865,dylan604,4 hours ago,"The list is so long. My favorite is the internal intervalometer + ETTR. Canon has always been laughed at for not having an internal intervalometer, and ML proves how lame it is to not have one. ETTR (Expose To The Right) is an auto metering mode that allows the camera to keep the histogram pushed as far to the right (better exposure) automagically by increasing shutter time and/or increasing ISO. This is essential for doing holy grail timelapse of sunset/sunrise where the exposure is constantly changing. This feature alone is worth it's weight in gold. However, a lot of the features exposed are more video oriented. The Canon bodies were primarily photo cameras that could shoot video in a cumbersome way. ML brings features a video shooter would need without diving into the menus like audio metering. The older bodies also have hardware limitations on write speed, so people use the HDMI out to external recorders to record a larger framesize/bitrate/codec than natively possible. Also, that feed normally has the camera UI overlay which prevents clean recordings. ML allows turning that off. There are just too many features that ML unlocks. You'd really just need to find the camera body you are interested in using on their site, and see what it does for that body. Different bodies have different features. So some effort is required on your part to know exactly what it can do for you. reply",Magic Lantern Is Back,felipemesquita,2025-08-30 21:52:58,https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=27315.0,439,143

  It is not complete (in ML hardly anything is) but allows to access a lot of ML and Canon functions. Years ago someone made a script for automating solar eclipse shooting catching all critical phases while chilling and enjoying the view.
- Introduced full electronic shutter (Silent Pic) for Digic 4 and 5. 
- Focus stacking for macro and - via Lua script - for landscape.
- Exposure simulation switch for ""cheaper"" cams
- Trap focus
- Dual-ISO. Some HDR mode but without ghosting by manipulating sensor lines to record  at different ISOs
- Ghost image overlay
- Customizable cropmark overlays (grids and others)
- Fps finetuning. Several folks used it to record vintage monitors with very, very strange timings and without rolling bars.30.01 fps? No problem!
- Zebras and focus peaking, vectorscope, wavelength monitoring, false colour support
- RAW histogram
- Bracketing with up to 11 frames (But why? ;-> ) 
- Intervalometer and bracketing (a bit more configurable than Canon has now)
- Trigger by LCD's IR sensor (if any) or Audio (clap your hand) or motion detect 
- Rack focus
- Display mirroring and upside/down options
- Configurable presets (up to 15)
- 30 minutes override for RAW recording, USB and HDMI streaming. Oh, and we have a new option to record native H.264/MOV for more than 29:59. Prototype but working.
-Better AF micoradjustment for the cams having that option by Canon.

Then they used the LED blinks to transmit the firmware out. Then they built custom firmware which boots right from SD (thus no posibility to break the camera). The Magic Lantern firmware for example allows many basic cameras to do RAW 4K video recording (with unlimited length) - feature which is not even in the high-end models.

    =============

    Magic Lantern (ML) is a software enhancement that offers increased
    functionality to the excellent Canon DSLR cameras.
      
    It's an open framework, licensed under GPL, for developing extensions to the
    official firmware.

    Magic Lantern is not a *hack*, or a modified firmware, **it is an
    independent program that runs alongside Canon's own software**. 
    Each time you start your camera, Magic Lantern is loaded from your memory
    card. Our only modification was to enable the ability to run software
    from the memory card.

    ML is being developed by photo and video enthusiasts, adding
    functionality such as: HDR images and video, timelapse, motion
    detection, focus assist tools, manual audio controls much more.

    For more details on Magic Lantern please see [http://www.magiclantern.fm/](http://www.magiclantern.fm/)

    There is a sibling repo for our patched version of Qemu that adds support
    for emulating camera ROMs. This allows testing without access to a physical
    camera, and automating tests across a suite of cameras.

Each individual can contribute what is unique to them, and grow more capable as they do so. Both people, and the community of those people remain alive, lively, and continue to grow. Some people call this paradigm “regenerative”; only living systems regenerate. There is another form of delegation where the work needed to be done is imposed onto another, in order to exploit and extract value. We are trying to do this with LLMs now, but we also did this during the Industrial Revolution, and before that, humanity enslaved each other to get the labor to extract value out of the land. This value extraction leads to degeneration, something that happens when living systems dies. While the Industrial Revolution afforded humanity a middle-class, and appeared to distribute the wealth that came about — resulting in better standards of living — it came along with numerous ills that as a society, we still have not really figured out. I think that, collectively, we figure that the LLMs can do the things no one wants to do, and so _everyone_ can enjoy a better standard of living.

To me, that's what makes it an abstraction layer, rather than just a servant or an employee. You have to break your entire architecture into units small enough that you know you can coax the machine to output good code for. The AI can't be trusted as far as you can throw it, but the distance from you to how far you can throw is the abstraction layer. An employee you can just tell to make it work, they'll kill themselves trying to do it, or be replaced if they don't; eventually something will work, and you'll take all the credit for it. AI is not experimenting, learning and growing, it stays stupid. The longer it thinks, the wronger it thinks. You deserve the credit (and the ridicule) for everything it does that you put your name on. ----- edit: and this thread seems to think that you don't have to check what your high level abstraction is doing. That's probably why most programs run like crap. You can't expect something you do in e.g. python to do the most algorithmically sensible thing, even if you wrote the algorithm just like the textbook said. It may make weird choices (maybe optimal for the general case, but horrifically bad for yours) that mean that it's not really running your cute algorithm at all, or maybe your cute algorithm is being starved by another thread that you have no idea why it would be dependent on. It may have made correct choices when you started writing, then decided to make wrong choices after a minor patch version change. To pretend perfection is a necessary condition for abstraction is not even somebody would say directly. Never. All we talk about is leaky abstractions. Remember when GTA loading times, which (a counterfactual because we'll never know) probably decimated sales, playtime, and at least the marketing of the game, turned out to be because they were scanning some large, unnecessary  json array (iirc) hundreds of times a second?

You can just do that . JIT Compiler acting up? Disable it entirely if you wish for more predictable & understandable execution of the code. And while people used to higher level languages don't know the finer details of assembly or even C's memory management, they can incrementally learn.

We chose essay writing as it is a cognitively complex task that engages multiple mental processes while being used as a common tool in schools and in standardized tests of a student's skills. Essay writing places significant demands on working memory,
requiring simultaneous management of multiple cognitive processes. A person writing an essay must juggle both macro-level tasks (organizing ideas, structuring arguments), and micro-level tasks (word choice, grammar, syntax). In order to evaluate cognitive engagement and cognitive load as well as to better understand the brain activations when performing a task of essay writing, we used Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain signals of the participants. In addition to using an LLM, we also want to understand and compare the brain activations when performing the same task using classic Internet search and when no tools (neither LLM nor search) are available to the user.

Generally, yes, low N is unequivocally worse than high N in supporting population-level claims, all else equal. With fewer participants or observations, a study has lower statistical power, meaning it is less able to detect true effects when they exist. This increases the likelihood of both Type II errors (failing to detect a real effect) and unstable effect size estimates. Small samples also tend to produce results that are more vulnerable to random variation, making findings harder to replicate and less generalizable to broader populations. In contrast, high-N studies reduce sampling error, provide more precise estimates, and allow for more robust conclusions that are likely to hold across different contexts.

After using ChatGPT for a while you develop somewhat of an instinct for when it might be hallucinating, especially when you start probing it for the ""why"" part and you get a feel for whether its explanations make sense. Having at least some domain knowledge helps too - you're more at risk of being fooled by hallucinations if you are trying to get it to do something you know nothing about. While not foolproof, when you combine this with some basic fact-checking (e.g. quickly skim read a command's man page to make sure the explanation for each flag sounds right, or read the relevant paragraph from the manual) plus the fact that you see in practice whether the proposed solution fixes the problem, you can reach a reasonably high level of accuracy most of the time. Even with the risk of hallucinations it's still a great time saver because you short-circuit the process of needing to work out which command is useful and reading the whole of the man page / manual until you understand which component parts do the job you want. It's not perfect but neither is Googling - that can lead to incorrect answers too. To give an example of my own, the other day I was building a custom Incus virtual machine image from scratch from an ISO. I wanted to be able to provision it with cloud-init (which comes configured by default in cloud-enabled stock Incus images). For some reason, even with cloud-init installed in the guest, the host's provisioning was being ignored. This is a rather obscure problem for which Googling was of little use because hardly anyone makes cloud-init enabled images from ISOs in Incus (or if they do, they don't write about it on the internet). At this point I could have done one of two things: (a) spend hours or days learning all about how cloud-init works and how Incus interacts with it until I eventually reached the point where I understood what the problem was; or (b) ask ChatGPT.

With LLMs I can get a broad overview of what I'm doing, tell it what materials I already have on hand and get specific ideas for how to practice. Soldering is probably one of the harder ones to learn by text, but the description of the techniques to use were actually really understandable (use flux, be sure the tip is tinned, touch the pad with the tip to warm it up a little, touch again with the iron on one side of the pad and insert the solder in on the other side and it gets drawn in, pull away (timing was trial and error). And then I'd upload a picture of what I did for review and it would point out the ones that had issues and what likely went wrong to cause it (ex: solder sticking to the top of the iron and not the pad), and I would keep practicing and test that it worked and looked like what was described.

Although I rarely use it for coding as my job is more at a higher level (designs etc), if I have the LLM write part of a trade-off analysis, I'll remember it less and be less engaged. What's really bothering me though, is that I enjoy my job less when using an LLM. I feel less accomplished, I learn less, and I overall don't derive the same value out of my work.. But, on the flip side, by not adopting an LLM I'll be slower than my peers, which then also impacts my job negatively.

I always review the code and I ask it to break it down into smaller steps but because I didn't actually write and think of the code myself, I don't have it all in my brain. Sure, yes I can spend a lot of time really going through it and building my mental model but it's not the same (for me). But this is also how I felt when I managed a small team once. When you start to manage more and code less, you have to let go of the fact that you have more intimate knowledge of the codebase and place that trust in your team. But at least you have a team of humans. AI agentic coding is like shifting your job from developer to manager.

But I've also significantly noticed further some of the ""harmful patterns"" I guess that I would not have noticed about... myself? For example, AI is way too eager to ""solve things"" when given a prompt, even if you give it an abstract one. It's unable to take a step back and just.... think? And hey, I notice that I do that too! Lol. It's helped me realize more refined ""stages"" of thinking I guess, even beyond just ""plan"" and ""solve"". But for sure a lot of the time I'm just lazy and ask AI to just ""go do it"" and turn off critical thinking, hoping that it can just 1 shot the problem instead of me breaking it down. Sometimes it genuinely works. Often it doesn't. I think if I stay way more intentional with my thinking, I can use it to good use.

When this happens they are able to drive correctly but don't really register every single action they've taken during the process.

That's the general principle, so it would be surprising if this were an exception. The age of social media and constant distraction already atrophies the ability to maintain sustained focus. Who reads a book these days, never mind a thick book requiring struggle to master? That requires immersion, sustained engagement, persevering through discomfort, and denying yourself indulgence in all sorts of temptations and enticements to get a cheap fix. It requires postponed gratification, or a gratification that is more subtle and measured and piecemeal rather than some sharp spike. We become conditioned in Pavlovian fashion, more habituated to such behavior, the more we engage in such behavior. The reliance on AI for writing is partly rooted in the failure to recognize that writing is a form of engagement with the material. Clear writing is a way of developing knowledge and understanding. It helps uncover what you understand and what you don't. If you can't explain something, you don't know it well enough to have clear ideas about it. What good does an AI do you - you as a knowing subject - if it does the ""writing"" for you? You, personally, don't become wiser or better. You don't become fit by watching others exercise. This isn't to say AI has no purpose, but our attitude toward technology is often irresponsible. We think that if we have the power to do something, we are missing out by not using it. This is boneheaded. The ultimate measure is whether the technology is good for you in some particular use case. Sometimes, we make prudential allowances for practical reasons. There can be a place for AI to ""write"" for us, but there are plenty of cases where it is simply senseless to use. You need to be prudent, or you end up abusing the technology. reply","MIT Study Finds AI Use Reprograms the Brain, Leading to Cognitive Decline",cainxinth,2025-09-03 12:06:19,https://publichealthpolicyjournal.com/mit-study-finds-artificial-intelligence-use-reprograms-the-brain-leading-to-cognitive-decline/,455,443

Hyperthreading (SMT) and Turbo (clock scaling) are only a part of the variables causing non-linearity, there are a number of other resources that are shared across cores and ""run out"" as load increases, like memory bandwidth, interconnect capacity, processor caches. Some bottlenecks might come even from the software, like spinlocks, which have non-linear impact on utilization. Furthermore, most CPU utilization metrics average over very long windows, from several seconds to a minute, but what really matters for the performance of a latency-sensitive server happens in the time-scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and a multi-second average will not distinguish a bursty behavior from a smooth one. The latter has likely much more capacity to scale up. Unfortunately, the suggested approach is not that accurate either, because it hinges on two inherently unstable concepts > Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency. The measurement of this is extremely noisy, as you want to detect the point where the server starts becoming unstable. Even if you look at a very simple queueing theory model, the derivatives close to saturation explode, so any nondeterministic noise is extremely amplified. > Report how much work your server is currently doing.

But most of these metrics are not very actionable anyway (the vast majority of people are not going to know what to do with their IPC or cache hit or branch hit numbers). What most people care about is some combination of latency and utilization. As a very rough rule of thumb, for many workloads you can get up to about 80% CPU utilization before you start seeing serious impacts on workload latency. Beyond that you can increase utilization but you start seeing your workload latency suffer from all of the effects you mentioned. To know how much latency is impacted by utilization you need to measure your specific workload. Also, how much you care about latency depends on what you're doing. In many cases people care much more about throughput than latency, so if that's the top metric then optimize for that.

That would certainly make it easier to figure out if it was worth going up to a higher power state, if I’m remembering correctly. reply",%CPU utilization is a lie,BrendanLong,2025-09-03 00:01:02,https://www.brendanlong.com/cpu-utilization-is-a-lie.html,403,140

Disabling SMT likely saves negligible amount of power, but disables any performance to be gained from the other thread. If there's thermal budget available, it's better to spend it by shoving more work onto the second thread than to leave it disabled.

If you've got a tight loop that uses all the processor execution resources, you're not gaining anything by splitting that in two, it just makes things harder. Or if your load is mostly bound by memory bandwidth without a lot of compute... having more threads probably means you're that much more oversubscribed on i/o and caching. But a lot of loads are grab some stuff from memory and then do some compute, rinse and repeat. There's a lot of potential for idle time while waiting on a load, being able to run something else during that time makes a lot of sense.

I've rebuilt my entire setup a while ago to ""tolerate"" power loss. - Everything is sliced into three zones: ""always-on"", ""desktop"", and ""homelab"". The latter two through a smart plug, so that power can be cut. - Always-on includes the SOHO router/AP, a RasPi4, and my Mac mini. The router's switch has only two ports populated: the Pi, and the Big Switch. - Desktop is things like the screen, speakers, dock, wireless charger, camera (dummy battery), cute lamp, etc. All of this can tolerate power loss at any moment. Homelab: this is the tricky part. There's a big (52 ports!) switch that ""everything else"" is plugged into, including my Mac (yay 10Gig Ethernet, not sure what for). A bunch of SBCs like Pis, NVidia Jetsons, x86's, etc. Nothing important, still figuring out what to do with all of that, so I kinda don't care if the power is cut. The important bit is the NAS (RAIDZ 3x3TB). ZFS makes you feel like you're invincible, but I've still built something to keep it clean: 1. it's powered down until required; 2. the router has a cron job to WoL the NAS 5min before all backup jobs start; 3. the NAS has its own cron job that waits for the backups to complete, then waits for all SSH sessions to terminate, then shuts itself down. You can kill the script via SSH. What I'm planning to do is to build a simple daemon for each box, that checks in once per minute or so, to ask if it's time to shut down. Once everyone is clear, cut the power. Somewhere far down my TODO list ;) until then, you can also use an iOS shortcut to SSH to each box before asking HomeKit to throw the switch, but storing passwords is fugly and handling separate pubkeys is too much bother.

45110209,45115828,wltr,4 hours ago,"I think about battery being the very dangerous thing to leave on 24/7, especially if that’s some remote location (like attic), or at home, but when you do not work from home. It may be dangerous, plus the battery may die pretty quickly. My first idea, to mitigate risk of fire, it’s possible to locate some hand made sand bag above the phone, so in case there’s fire, the sand would neutralise it. Also, I’d try to emulate charge-discharge cycles by enabling and disabling smart socket. I wonder if that’s possible to automate using the phone itself. E.g. when it reaches 20% it enables smart charger, and disables it upon reaching 80%. So it can do it in perpetuity. Since the screen would be off all the time, I guess one charging cycle would be once a few days. Which is twice or thrice better than average user who charges their phone once or even twice a day. So, theoretically, a Pixel with a new battery might survive a few years, if not 5 years, off one battery. Then a user might replace the battery. So, theoretically, rubbing it a server is entirely possible, I guess. Otherwise, super cool. I’d love to try this myself now. I guess that may be a perfect solar-powered server. For it, maybe one doesn’t want a smart charger. Just let the sun charge the thing whenever there’s a sunny day. reply",This blog is running on a recycled Google Pixel 5 (2024),indigodaddy,2025-09-02 22:58:23,https://blog.ctms.me/posts/2024-08-29-running-this-blog-on-a-pixel-5/,335,141

The difference isn't what's finishing a project is, is the dissonance between what M4v3R and rhubarbtree understand when talking about ""nontrivial production"" software.

And you're required to adhere to these requirements stringently. That's an environment that's inherently a bad fit for vibe coding. It can still be used there, too, but you will not get a 2-3x speed up, because the LLM will always introduce minor behavioral changes - which aren't important in M4v3R scenario, but a complete deal breaket for rhubarbtree.

It's still fundamentally about the code. I think you're missing the difference between a 10/100k+ lines of code professional software vs a quick 3k lines greenfield project. In a few thousand lines of code you can get away with a massive amount of code bloat, quick hacks and inconsistent APIs. In a program that's anything more than a few thousand lines, you can't. It just becomes too confusing. You have to be deliberate. Code has to follow patterns so the cognitive load is lowered. Stuff has to be split up in a predictable manner. And there's another problem, sensible and predictable maintenance. Changes and fixes have to be targeted and specific. They have to be written to avoid side-effect. For organisation, it's been a huge effort on everyone's part these last 30 years to achieve that. Make code understandable, by organising it better. From one direction, languages have improved, with authors reducing boilerplate + cross-pollination of ideas between languages like anonymous methods. On the other, it's developers inventing + describing patterns or KISS or the single responsibility principle. Or even seemingly trivial things like choosing predictable folder structures and enforcing indentation rules[1]. I'm starting to feel that's often the main skill a senior dev brings to the table, organising code well. Better code organization has made it possible for developers to make larger program. Code organisation is a need that becomes a big problem if you're not doing it well in large projects, but not really a problem if you're not doing it well in small projects. And right now, AI isn't very good at code organisation. We might believe that you have to have a mental model of the whole program in your head, something an LLM is just not capable of right now. And I don't know if that's going to turn out to be a solvable problem as it seems like a huge context problem. For maintenance, I'm not sure. AI seems pretty terrible at it. It often rewrites everything and throws the baby out with the bathwater. Again, it's a context problem. Both could turn out to be easy to solve for this generation of AI, in the end.

Just look at tests. Especially, if you want to do something which was never done before, the disparity can be staggering. Claude Code for example is also not that quick at all. It produces some code quickly, but even scaffolding three hello world level example projects together definitely takes more than an hour. And that’s with zero novelty. The first version of code is done quickly, but the continuous loop of self corrections after that takes a long time. Even with Serena, Context7, and other MCPs. And, of course, without real code review. That’s easily hours even with just few thousands lines of code, if it uses something which you don’t know. But I know that almost everybody gave up understanding “their” “own” code, during vibe coding. Even before AIs, it was a well known fact, that real code reviewing is hard, and people rarely did it. AI can make you quicker in certain situations, but these “15 minutes” claims are totally baseless.

45107962,45113491,thecupisblue,10 hours ago,"Great video! Even more, shows a few things - how good it is with such a niche language but also exposes some direct flaws. First off, Rust represents quite a small part of the training dataset (last I checked it was under 1% of code dataset) in most public sets, so it's got waaay less training then other languages like TS or Java. You added 2 solid features, backed with tests and documentation and nice commit messages. 80% of devs would not deliver this in 2.5 hours. Second, there was a lot of time/token waste messing around with git and git messages. Few tips I noticed that could help you in the workflow: #1: Add a subagent for git that knows your style, so you don't poison direct claude context and spend less tokens/time fighting it. #2: Claude has hooks, if your favorite language has a formatter like rust fmt, just use hooks to run rust fmt and similar. #3: Limit what they test, as most LLM models tend to write overeager tests, including testing if ""the field you set as null is null"", wasting tokens. #5: Saying ""max 50 characters title"" doesn't really mean anything to the LLM. They have no inherent ability to count, so you are relying on probability, which is quite low since your context is quite filled at this point. If they want to count the line length, they also have to use external tools.

To summarize, the authors enlisted a panel of expert developers to review the quality of various pull requests, in terms of architecture, readability, maintainability, etc. (see 8:27 in the video for a partial list of criteria), and then somehow aggregate these criteria into an overall ""productivity score."" They then trained a model on the judgments of the expert developers, and found that their model had a high correlation with the experts' judgment. Finally, they applied this model to PRs across thousands of codebases, with knowledge of whether the PR was AI-assisted or not. They found a 35-40% productivity gain for easy/greenfield tasks, 10-15% for hard/greenfield tasks, 15-20% for easy/brownfield tasks, and 0-10% for hard/brownfield tasks. Most productivity gains went towards ""reworked"" code, i.e. refactoring of recent code. All in all, this is a great attempt at rigorously quantifying AI impact. However, I do take one major issue with it. Let's assume that their ""productivity score"" does indeed capture the overall quality of a PR (big assumption). I'm not sure this measures the overall net positive/negative impact to the codebase. Just because a PR is well-written according to a panel of expert engineers doesn't mean it's valuable to the project as a whole. Plenty of well-written code is utterly superfluous (trivial object setters/getters come to mind). Conversely, code that might appear poorly written to an outsider expert engineer could be essential to the project (the highly optimized C/assembly code of ffmpeg comes to mind, or to use an extreme example, anything from Arthur Whitney). ""Reworking"" that code to be ""better written"" would be hugely detrimental, even though the judgment of an outside observer (and an AI trained on it) might conclude that said code is terrible. reply",A staff engineer's journey with Claude Code,kmelve,2025-09-02 19:34:24,https://www.sanity.io/blog/first-attempt-will-be-95-garbage,495,347

Everyone knows that LLMs are fantastic at generating greenfield boilerplate very quickly. They are an invaluable rapid prototyping/MVP generation tool, and that in itself is hugely useful. But that's not where developers spend most of their time. They spend it maintaining complicated, mature codebases, and the utility of LLMs is much less proven for that use case.

The documentation is incomplete and unclear, and even to the extent that it is clear it has a different syntax with different limitations than are used to configure permissions for the root agent. When you ask Claude itself to generate agent configurations, as is recommended, it will generate permissions that do not exist anywhere in the documentation and may or may not be valid, but there’s no error admitted if an invalid permission is set. If you ask it to explain, it gets confused by their own documentation and tells you it doesn’t know why it did that.

I’ve noticed colleagues who enjoy Claude code are more interested in “just ship it!” (and anecdotally are more extroverted than myself). I find Claude code to be oddly unsatisfying. Still trying to put my finger on it, but I think it’s that I quickly lose context. Even if I understand the changes CC makes, it’s not the same as wrestling with a problem and hitting roadblocks and overcoming. With CC I have no bearing on whether I’m in an area of code with lots of room for error, or if I’m standing in the edge of a cliff and can’t cross some line in the design. I’m way more concerned with understanding the design and avoiding future pain than my “ship it” colleagues (and anecdotally am way more introverted). I see what they build and, yes, it’s working, for now, but the table relationships aren’t right and this is going to have to be rebuilt later, except now it’s feeding a downstream report that’s being consumed by the business, so the beta version is now production. But the 20 other things this app touches indirectly weren’t part of the vibe coding context, so the design obviously doesn’t account for that. It could, but of course the “ship it” folks aren’t the ones that are going to build out lengthy requirements and scopes of work and document how a dozen systems relate to and interact with each other. I guess I’m seeing that the speed limit of quality is still the speed of my understanding, and (maybe more importantly) that my weaponizing of my own obsession only works when I’m wrestling and overcoming, not just generating code as fast as possible.

The exact skill you mentioned - can visualize the plan for a change quickly - is what makes my LLM usage so powerful, imo. I can say the right precise wording in my prompt to guide it to a good plan very quickly. As the other commenter mentioned, the entire above process only takes something like 30-120 minutes depending on scope, and then I can generate code in a few minutes that would take 2-6 weeks to write myself, working 8 hr days. Then, it takes something like 0.5-1.5 days to work out all the bugs and clean up the weird AI quirks and maybe have the LLM write some playwright tests or whatever testing framework you use for integration tests to verify it's own work. So yes, it takes significant time to plan things well for good results, and yes the results are often sloppy in some parts and have weird quirks that no human engineer would make on purpose, but if you stick to working on prompt/context engineering and getting better and faster at the above process, the key unlock is not that it just does the same coding for you, with it generating the code instead.

Additionally, as you point out, the language and frameworks need to be part of the training set since AI isn't really ""learning"" it's just prepolulating a context window for its pre-existing knowledge (token prediction), so ymmv depending on hidden variables from the secret (to you, the consumers) training data and weights.

I find it difficult to include examples because a lot of my work is boring backend work on existing closed-source applications. It's hard to share, but I'll give it a go with a few examples :) ---- First example: Our quota detection system (shipped last month) handles configurable threshold detection across billing metrics. The business logic is non-trivial, distinguishing counter vs gauge metrics, handling multiple consumers, and efficient SQL queries across time windows. Claude's evolution:
 - First pass: Completely wrong approach (DB triggers)
 - Second pass: Right direction, wrong abstraction
 - Third pass: Working implementation, we could iterate on ----
Second example: Sentry monitoring wrapper for cron jobs, a reusable component to help us observe our cronjob usage Claude's evolution:
 - First pass: Hard-coded the integration into each cron job, a maintainability nightmare.
 - Second pass: Using a wrapper, but the config is all wrong
 - Third pass: Again, OK implementation, we can iterate on it ---- The ""80%"" isn't about line count; it's about Claude handling the exploration space while I focus on architectural decisions. I still own every line that ships, but I'm reviewing and directing rather than typing. This isn't writing boilerplate, it's core billing infrastructure.

Consumer MAX ($200/month) works for lighter usage but hits limits quickly with parallel agents and large codebases. For context: that's 1-2% of a senior engineer's fully loaded cost. The ROI is clear if it delivers even 10% productivity gain (we're seeing 2-3x on specific tasks). You're right that many devs can start with MAX plans. The higher tier becomes necessary when running multiple parallel contexts and doing systematic exploration (the ""3-attempt pattern"" burns tokens fast).

In this case, here we have an idea of making new typeballs for IBM typewriters. Here is one post where someone is playing with the idea. At the top of the page, there is a link to a GitHub page for you to adapt it as you see fit. But then there’s also a link to a new page: https://selectricrescue.org/ where someone makes many more varieties, also with code for you to try yourself. I see 3d printing much like the world of early open source coding. Sometimes you get a completed project that works out of the box. But often, you’ll have to tinker and adapt it to your exact hardware. Once a new 3d model is shown to be viable, it can be mixed and matched to make something new! reply",Comic Sans typeball designed to work with the IBM Selectric typewriters,Sami_Lehtinen,2025-09-03 03:13:05,https://www.printables.com/model/441233-comic-sans-typeball-for-the-ibm-selectric-typewrit,137,31

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kXnsvYfaF4&t=2160s (it was an aside to a longer Selectric project I did; this typeball project came out around the same time so I decided to make a few of them). Watching this back, it partially works but some of the letters clearly need their positions adjusted, and some of them seem to have trouble imprinting fully on the page. That's besides the fact that the proportional fonts look pretty weird when printed monospaced. I didn't really go further with this because the resin printed balls didn't hold up very well. A slot near the hole would always break open, and then the ball would spin freely instead of being indexed like it was supposed to. These days I've pretty much abandoned home resin printing entirely since it is extremely messy, and I've never been able to make parts with it that weren't ridiculously brittle, even with the supposedly ""strong"" or ""tough"" resins. I've used commercial resin prints that Shapeways/Xometry/PCBWAY have and they are a lot tougher, so maybe they would work well. reply",Comic Sans typeball designed to work with the IBM Selectric typewriters,Sami_Lehtinen,2025-09-03 03:13:05,https://www.printables.com/model/441233-comic-sans-typeball-for-the-ibm-selectric-typewrit,137,31

From past experience, vendors like SuperMicro aren't much cheaper at scale because Dell can give 80% discounts on volume, and most Dell server sales are done via Channel with an MSP who will manage and administer the system. Ofc, this continues to reinforce my belief that the ""AI boom"" in it's current form (and once you remove the scooby doo monster mask) is basically a ""Datacenter/Telecom Bubble"" 2.0 like back in 2000-01. The multiples, messaging, vendors, and margins are almost the exact same. During the Dot-com Boom, Telecom and hardware companies were also expanding DC and telecom capacity massively (to surf and host a website on the Internet, you kinda need Internet and web hosting), and when the Dotbomb happened, the Telco bubble collapsed subsequently as well (remember WorldCom/MCI?) That's why the 2000s were horrible for anyone with a CS/CE/CSE/EE degree, because both software AND hardware industries collapsed. Imagine a world in the late 2020s where you cannot land a job as a Fullstack Engineer OR an ML Infra Engineer - that was the 2000s except with older stacks. That's also why I'd be optimistic if a bust happens - the overcapacity in compute that arose from the Telecom and Dot-Com Busts both helped usher the Cloud, SaaS, E-Commerce, and Social Media boom because the infra has been laid and became cost effective. It is also in this context that Paul G's ""cockroach"" and ""ramen profitability"" essay came to the fore. reply","With AI Boom, Dell's Datacenter Biz Is Finally Bigger Than Its PC Biz",rbanffy,2025-08-30 14:48:58,https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/08/29/with-ai-boom-dells-datacenter-biz-is-finally-bigger-than-its-pc-biz/,89,76

45075123,45118676,Fade_Dance,45 minutes ago,"I'll give this a shot, as I spend my days managing a portfolio exposed to sector rotations on the mid-length timeframe. ______________________________________ It is not ideal to think in terms of amorphous projections where you sum up every probability. Try and consider at least some path dependence and realize that there is a risk distribution. What you are specifically looking at is the scenario where there is a) an AI bubble in the public markets (remember, much of AI of it is marked numbers in the VC world) and b) the possible scenario where the grey swan gets big enough and the risk of violent unwind is high enough to where you see arguable value in shifting to defensive positioning in a somewhat diversified portfolio. I'll assume you are weighted heavy to QQQ/NASDAQ in the portfolio. If you have a truly diversified portfolio with rules for systematic rebalancing, you never manually shift to defensive (obviously what I and most advisors would recommend). The first note is that an ""AI bubble"" in public markets, assuming there is one, is very much tied to the overall state of high market concentration in the trillion dollar tech names. To see a violent AI bubble unwind, it will almost necessarily involve the ""concentration bubble""/Nifty 50 2.0 unwinding as well. That means the AI Bubble narrative in public markets is tied to overall market liquidity just as much as the AI specific factors. The passive complex will put a large continual bid in for NVDA/GOOGL/AMZN/etc even in the case of an AI downturn, which should neutralize the violent unwind scenario unless both impulses turn negative (active money moving out of AI, and passive money pulling out of broad based ETFs entirely). Of course the relationship above is reflexive, which is to say that NVDA gapping 20% down on earnings may well spur wider outflows (as you personally alluded to when your response would be to ""go full defensive in my portfolio""), and vice versa. So what you want to be watching is specifically for signs of this contagion spreading. If liquidity/flows strongly turns negative, the concentration bubble unwinds, NVDA and co tank, and that likely triggers a sell-off in the AI speculative names and qualifies as an ""AI Bubble Burst"". Therefore you want to be watching general economic weakness like recession signals, layoffs, etc. Bond yields blowing out will also likely kill the AI bubble, as it's capital intensive. Even with the fortress balance sheets of the hyperscalers, the long end blowing out (it's starting to press into dangerous territory currently) would likely kill a hypothetical ""AI Bubble"". So watch bond yields (and bond volatility / MOVE index). More specific areas I would be watching is Hyperscaler Capex projections in earnings calls (watch it like a hawk), and some aspects of the trade war such as global digital services taxes in particular (because profit shocks for hyperscalers will likely result in reduced capex to preserve their earnings targets). I would also be watching competition for NVIDIA in the more grey swan areas, like Huwawei revealing a chip with twice the performance per watt as NVDA chips for half the price, and a surprise software stack that kicks ass (so the low single digit outcome areas regarding Chinese competition particularly, which wouldn't actually be bad for AI, but would likely result in a shock move of money leaving US related AI names on public markets, which would be a repeat of the February to April move we saw earlier this year in response to DeepSeek. Markets have memory.) So let's sketch out some risks over the next few years. Now we get to the part that usually adds little to no value (making predictions about where markets will go). Hint: nobody can do this broadly. Sometimes one may have specific value-adding strong convictions picked out of the universe of possibilities, but those are the exceptions. I'll even put a % chance guess since that's what you're looking for, but it adds literally no value. Bonds blowing out: low/moderate likelihood. 15-20% over the next few years for a major bond event imo, and I'd carry that directly to a 20% chance of an AI unwind. Heavy economic downturn: moderately likely. 25% or so. And since the scenarios overlap somewhat (stagflation would involve both, and it's a leading wider risk currently), let's move the risk to 30%. But remember that this is a risk scenario that will involve market cap weighted passive indexes as well, so we're really talking about market downturn risk rather than just the AI Bubble popping concurrently, since the latter is less meaningful in comparison even when we're focusing on portfolios. Now on to the AI specific scenarios, which would be AI falling out of favor with consumers. I personally put this under 5%, so I have strong conviction this won't be the case. I'm mostly disregarding this risk. Most would probably put it closer to 20%, and some would be 50/50 if they think it's a fad. You will find a wide array of predictions here. How about tech industry specific shocks like global digital services taxes causing a sharp drop in AI investment from the huge balance sheets driving it all? I think it's fairly unlikely as well, maybe 5-10% or so. I have high certainty that Google and Apple in particular are going to have great cashflow for the next few years. There are some side-lines to watch here though. Ex: the US government itself is strongly fending off digital services taxes in trade negotiations and using a big stick, but if the tariffs are confirmed to be nullified (recent court ruling), and tariffs are unwound, the world may use the opportunity to tax the multinational American tech companies while the US is stunned and weak, so to speak, especially if some of the other lines are playing out like bond yields getting dangerous, which puts pressure on global govs to raise revenue. That's an example of the sort of thinking that is required to really position a portfolio for things like esoteric crashes in specific sectors and have positive expectancy. You have to take into account all of these self-reinforcing feedback loops and get creative/contrarian to some degree, and find out where the market may be underpriced/offer value hedges and hidden synergistic correlations. Or you can pay up for generic tail protection/put options, and just pay the tax to cover the risk. In your case, perhaps that would be a good option? Just pay up for a put spread on NVIDIA that has a 10 to 1 payout ratio, spend 0.5% of your portfolio, and hey, you get a 5% payout in the case of an AI unwind (you don't need to go overboard, a 5% cash payout is a huge gift in a market crash while most are in panic). On NVIDIA in particular. I do think there's a moderate risk that NVIDIA is in an outright bubble currently. I could easily see a scenario where guidance comes in weak, margins come down for some reason (even something like a string of bad tape-outs at TSMC... could be anything), and NVIDIA re-rates lower. That would be painful for the entire market, and this is the risk I would be paying up to hedge (I'm currently hedging this a bit). I think there's a good 1/3 chance that NVIDIA tanks sometime over the next few years, but half of these scenarios would just be contained to NVIDIA and more to do with margins coming down to earth a bit (wow, this is quite nice just to be able to conjure up BS % numbers like that). ____________________________________ So in closing, just worry about having a properly diversified portfolio that self-rebalances according to proven rules. Ask yourself if there was an AI unwind, how would my portfolio look, and does this aligns with my financial goals and risk tolerance? Also ask yourself what would happen if it further picked up steam, since upside risk/opportunity cost is important as well. As previously mentioned, you are concerned with a scenario that closely correlates to index concentration as well, so also ask yourself how it looks if the current market leaders perform badly, and other sectors/market factors drive performance going forwards. reply","With AI Boom, Dell's Datacenter Biz Is Finally Bigger Than Its PC Biz",rbanffy,2025-08-30 14:48:58,https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/08/29/with-ai-boom-dells-datacenter-biz-is-finally-bigger-than-its-pc-biz/,89,76

45072481,45113380,testdelacc1,10 hours ago,"LLVM is the code generation backend used in several languages, like Rust and one of the many compilers for C and C++ (clang). Code generated by these compilers is considered “fast/performant” thanks to LLVM. The problem with LLVM has always been that it takes a long time to produce code. The post in the link promises a new backend that produces a slower artifact, but does so 10-20x quicker. This is great for debug builds. This doesn’t mean the compilation as a whole gets quicker. There are 3 steps in compilation - Front end: transforms source code into an LLVM intermediation representation (IR) - Backend: this is where LLVM comes in. It accepts LLVM IR and transforms it into machine code - Linking: a separate program links the artifacts produced by LLVM. How long does each step take? Really depends on the program we’re trying to compile. This blog post contains timings for one example program ( https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc/ ) to give you an idea. It also depends on whether LLVM is asked to produce a debug build (not performant, but quicker to produce) or a release build (fully optimised, takes longer). The 10-20x improvement described here doesn’t work yet for clang or rustc, and when it does it will only speed up the backend portion.

Though I can't verify this because their benchmark setup seems a bit more involved.

I was musing over something, though. We have creeping Orwellian things like face recognition and the policing of chat histories. But some of this is private, as in, not done by the state. Even when done by the state, it isn't in most places to prop up the regime and prevent dissent. It's big brother mechanisms without a Big Brother. I speculate that it's genuinely motivated by preventing disorder, because (is this true?) over the last couple of decades people have got more disorderly in petty ways to do with thieving and harassing and scamming one another.

Society tolerates the use of physical force less, and has higher standards of health and safety, and more suing and seeking compensation. The police and security then favor electronic methods over potentially injuring themselves or anybody else. Then there's more potential to be bad in small ways because nobody's going to grab you by the collar.  Meanwhile, there's opportunities for internet crime, or electronic organized crime, or just mobs and riots. Then the shift in emphasis to electronic control spills over into the private sphere, and the public kind of support it while resenting it at the same time.

One city really did set up a full social credit system, but that was a pilot project and didn't work out.[1] There are some private ""social credit"" systems, like the one from Ant, but that's more like a rewards program - buy stuff, get points. China has had a lot of official social control for centuries, but it was local and managed by local cops.[2] As the population became more mobile, that wasn't enough.
But a single national system never emerged. There was a work record history, the Dang'an, created by the Party but to some extent pre-dating communism. This, again, was handled locally, by Party officials. This system didn't cope well with employee mobility. But it didn't get built into a comprehensive national system, either. China is authoritarian, but most of the mechanisms of coercion are local. Local political bullies are a constant low-level problem. Kind of like rural Alabama.

We pretend our algorithmic reputation scores are just “user experience features.” At least Beijing admits they're gamifying human behavior. Um no. That is not the only difference by a LONG SHOT. If I want to evaluate whether or not I want to involve myself with you, in any capacity, then that negotiation is between you and me. I can ask for references. I can ask for a credit check. I can go pay for a police background check. I can read public review sites. Or, I might decide that because you listen to country & western music you're not a real person and I can't know you and leave the vetting at that. Consequentially, however, that dealing impacts our relationship and none other. You might find other people who don't care about the same ""social credit criteria"" that I do and you might find yourself dealing with them instead. That's kind of the beauty of this thing we call ""freedom."" Anyone gets to choose who they want to deal with (or not) and make their own individual choices. The ""systems"" they opt in are always opt in (or at least they should be). The difference between a government ""social credit"" system and individuals (businesses or people) vetting other individuals based on their own chosen requirements is force. A government system mandates this across society in a broad authoritarian sweep. Get on the bad side of ""the party"" and now you are a social pariah and will not have any luck finding anyone who wants to deal with you, country music lovers be damned, because it is forced upon everyone. A business has no choice but to apply ""the"" system because if they don't they get punished. It is not opt-in, it is a one-sized-fits-all mandated by force of law system that removes individual discretion and choice from the equation. That's a LOT different than just ""we're upfront about it."" Furthermore, while I appreciate when authoritarians are honest about their violations of basic human rights and freedoms, that doesn't suddenly make what they are doing OK.

There are a host of behaviors and traits that private businesses are not allowed to consider when choosing whether or not to provide you products or services. These carve-outs to free association exist because at any given time a large enough portion of the population exists of bigots who choose their associations based on characteristics that the rest of society has decided are not acceptable grounds for refusing service. So we compel service if we think not providing it is sufficiently shitty and harmful.

Such institutions are put under even stricter standards for association.

I'm saying my fear that they might isn't unfounded * To Prevent Unfair and Unfounded Ratings: Uber could argue that some riders misuse the rating system. They might give a driver a low rating for reasons outside of the driver's control, such as traffic, a bad mood, or a simple misunderstanding. This policy would be presented as a way to protect drivers from being unfairly penalized, which could affect their livelihood. * To Combat ""Rating Terrorism"" or Coercion: A rider might threaten a driver with a low rating to get a free ride, demand an unscheduled stop, or force them to violate a rule. By banning riders who frequently give low scores, Uber would be taking a stance against this kind of behavior, ensuring that the rating system is used as a genuine feedback mechanism, not a tool for coercion. * To Discourage ""Troll"" Behavior: Some users might be incentivized to give consistently low ratings just to cause trouble or get attention, a practice often referred to as ""trolling."" This policy would be framed as a way to filter out users who are not participating in the community in good faith and are instead just trying to cause problems. * To Maintain Driver Confidence in the Platform: Drivers rely on their ratings to maintain their account status. If they feel that riders are unfairly giving them low scores without consequence, they may become disillusioned with the platform and switch to a competitor. Banning riders who give consistently low ratings would be a way to show drivers that Uber has their back. * To Improve Service by Identifying and Removing ""Unreasonable"" Riders: Uber could frame this as a data-driven approach. They might claim that their internal data shows a small percentage of riders who give low ratings to virtually every driver, regardless of the quality of the service. By removing these outliers, they would be improving the overall efficiency and health of the marketplace for the vast majority of drivers and riders. The goal would be to cultivate a community of ""reasonable"" users who understand and use the ratings system as it was intended. To continue, for me, my experience is I would rate low probably 7 of 8 drivers for the reasons I gave above. They all break traffic laws and drive recklessly. I kind of wish the app would let me set a driver preference. I'd chose (*) drive at the speed limit. Don't break any laws. Drive cautiously. others might choose (*) get there as fast as possible - (implying ignoring speed limits, weaving through traffic, cutting people off, ignoring turn lanes, etc...) At least that way the driver would know up front what the user expects. Me, I'd give them 5 stars for not risking my life. Others would give them 5 stars for going as fast as possible. As it is, I don't rate them low.

I don't know if it will ever be production-ready, but I've learned a lot and it's been a ton of fun. reply","Lit: a library for building fast, lightweight web components",merqurio,2025-09-03 06:14:22,https://lit.dev,225,148

45112720,45117006,jfagnani,3 hours ago,"Lots of comments in here are about shadow DOM, so let me give my take in one place: Yes, Lit uses shadow DOM by default (for good reasons, I think!) and yes you can turn it off component-by-component, but that does bring some challenges. Shadow DOM is most fundamentally just a private branch of the DOM tree for a component's internal DOM details. Frameworks have this implicitly with DOM defined in a component's template vs passed as children. But that distinction isn't visible to other code, the browser, and CSS. This is both good and bad. The biggest thing this separate tree gives us is the ability to tell what nodes are ""children"" - those are the light DOM children. Once you can separate children from internals, you can build slots. Slots are holes in the internals that children get rendered into. Without something like shadow DOM you can't have slots. And without slots you don't have interoperable composition and you don't have viable container elements. You need some way to place children in an element that isn't confused with the element's own DOM. So to me, before encapsulation and style scoping, interoperable composition is the most important feature, and that's really why Lit defaults to shadow DOM on. Without it we'd need some special `.children` property and Lit's component composition suddenly wouldn't be compatible with everyone else. But the style encapsulation is often a major pain for developers, especially if they're trying to integrate web components into an existing system with whole-page stylesheets. It's a big blocker to a lot of design systems porting to web components. That's one reason I proposed something called ""Open Styleable Shadow Roots""[1] which would let styles from outer scopes cascade into a shadow root - a way to break open style encapsulation but keep slots. It's been hard convincing browser vendors that this is needed, but I'm holding out hope that it makes progress soon.

45112720,45114510,rs186,7 hours ago,"I have used both. Personally I prefer Vue a bit more. * Built-in state management especially as in v3 (ref/reactive) is super powerful, and you can test the setup function logic by itself without any dependency on DOM which is convenient. By comparison, reactivity in Lit is basic (by design), and mostly work on the widget level -- if something changes, you need to trigger the update process of the widget. * The lifecycle is also a bit simpler. In Lit, you often need to work with lifecycle callbacks like firstUpdated, connected, shouldUpdate, updated, disconnected etc. (You don't need to implement these for simpler widgets, but often you have to.) You can easily run into bugs if you are not careful, especially in the less common situation where your widget can be both temporarily and permanently removed from the DOM, in which case you need to make sure the state of the widget is properly perserved, which isn't a thing you need to worry about in Vue. We got bitten by this multiple times. Unless there is a strong technical reason, I suggest that you focus on shipping features instead of changing your tech stack.

45112720,45114258,Ruphin,7 hours ago,"I don't know if there is a particular benefit, it's just different. On the consumer side there is no difference, because they consume Web Components, and that is what both solutions deliver. On the implementation side, I can think of a few differences: Vue is more of a ""framework"" solution and has more things built-in. You can do the same things with Lit, but the implementation would look different, because you'd lean more on native APIs. A good example of that is the event model, Vue has some event model built in, but with Lit you would use EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). Lit is a runtime solution, it doesn't require a build and you can  load your source directly in the browser. Vue on the other hand requires some form of compiler stage to produce something your browser can use. Compilers these days are fast, and Lit is specifically engineered to not have runtime performance overhead, so in practice this difference is rather minor. It is a very fundamental difference, so I think it's worth pointing out. Vue can compile to other targets. If you are only delivering Web Components, this is mostly irrelevant, but in theory a consumer might be able to use the Vue components directly in their Vue project, which might give them a better DX. On the other hand, Lit is specifically designed to produce Web Components, so you'll probably have a bit less friction compares to using Vue, e.g when some Vue concept doesn't compile cleanly to Web Components. Is there a major benefit to choosing one implementation over the other? I don't think so, unless you have a very particular requirement that one of them addresses that the other doesn't. For nearly all cases, it is just a different implementation syntax. In most cases the only relevant metric in deciding between them is what technology your developers are more familiar/comfortable with. reply","Lit: a library for building fast, lightweight web components",merqurio,2025-09-03 06:14:22,https://lit.dev,225,148

Different backend urls if deploying to test envs. Running unit tests on rebuild to avoid regressions.

45112720,45113856,jfagnani,9 hours ago,"There really is no way to metaprogram against class fields except with decorators. Class fields aren't on the prototype. They're essentially Object.defineProperty() calls that occur right after the super() call of a constructor. You can't get at them at all from the class declaration. I know more than one way to do something is sometimes a downside, but we have a large audience an a huge portion of it wants to use TypeScript and declarators, and another huge portion of it wants to use vanilla JavaScript. We factored things to give the best DX we could to each group with relatively little cost to us. As for why metaprogramming, we want a component to update when it's state is changed. Like plain web components, Lit uses classes. So here, we want setting `el.name` to cause the component to re-render: class MyElement extends LitElement {

      name = 'World';

      render() {
        return html`<h1>Hello ${this.name}</h1>`
      }
    } We do that by replacing `name` with a getter/setter pair where the setter schedules an update of the instance. Without decorators, there's no way to see that `name` even exists, much less replace it. Decorators actually do the replacement for us, we just have to build the thing to replace it with: class MyElement extends LitElement {

      @property() accessor name = 'World';

        return html`<h1>Hello ${this.name}</h1>`

Developers seem to understand the small syntax carve-out just fine. No, there are no custom JavaScript rules. Templates have some rules. I'm not sure why they wouldn't? In general you can't make things like tag and attribute names dynamic because you can't change them in HTML. You can actually write the template you show with what we call static templates though. `classMap()` is a template directive.

Meanwhile many LLM sites are not blind-friendly, like Claude, Perplexity, and there are sites that try but fail so exasperatingly hard that I lose any motivation for filing reports where I can't even begin to explain what's breaking so hard. It's evident that OpenWebUI have not tested their accessibility with a screen reader. Anyway blindness organizations (NFB mainly) have standardized on just use ChatGPT and everything else is the wild west where they absolutely do not care. Gemini could be more accessible, on web and especially Android, but all reports have been ignored so I'm not going to bother with them anymore. It's sad since their AI describes images well. Thank goodness for the API, and tools like [PiccyBot]( https://www.piccybot.com/ ) on iOS/Android and [viewpoint]( https://viewpoint.nibblenerds.com/ ) and [OmniDescriber]( https://audioses.com/en/yazilimlar.php ) on Windows. I'm still waiting for iOS to catch up to Android in LLM image descriptions built into the screen reader. Meanwhile, at least we have [this shortcut]( https://shortcutjar.com/describe/documentation/ ). It uses GPT 4O but at least it's something. Apple could easily integrate with their own Apple Intelligence to call out to ChatGPT or whatever, but I guess competition has to happen. Or something. Maybe next year lol. In the meantime I'll either use my own cents to get descriptions or share to Seeing AI or something like a cave man. reply",AI is going great for the blind (2023),ljlolel,2025-09-03 07:07:03,https://robertkingett.com/posts/6230/,87,53

I would rather be able to see the probably dozens of pages ruling with the full details rather than hear it secondhand from a reporter at this point.  It feels like they want to be the gatekeepers of information, and poor ones at that. I think it should be adopted as standard journalistic practice in fact -- reporting on court rulings must come with the PDF.

Can anyone now simply claim they're a competitor and get access to Google's tons of data? I am not too familiar with antitrust precedent, but to what extent does the judge rule on how specific the data sharing need to be (what types of data, for what time span, how anonymized, etc. etc.) or appoint a special master?

45108548,45109478,Hard_Space,20 hours ago,"> By the way, a pet peeve of mine right now is that reporters covering court cases never seem to simply paste the link to the online PDF decision/ruling for us all to read right in the story. I presume that this falls under the same consideration as direct links to science papers in articles that are covering those releases. Far as I can tell, the central tactic for lowering bounce rate and increasing 'engagement' is to link out sparsely, and, ideally, not at all. I write articles on new research papers, and always provide a direct link to the PDF,; but nearly all major sites fail to do this, even when the paper turns out to be at Arxiv, or otherwise directly available (instead of having been an exclusive preview offered to the publication by the researchers, as often happens at more prominent publications such as Ars and The Register). In regard to the few publishers that do provide legal PDFs in articles, the solution I see most often is that the publication hosts the PDF itself, keeping the reader in their ecosystem. However, since external PDFs can get revised and taken down, this could also be a countermeasure against that. reply",Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts,colesantiago,2025-09-02 20:26:47,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html,831,572

Journalists don't make it easy for you to access primary sources because of a mentality and culture issue. They see themselves as gatekeepers of information and convince themselves that readers can't handle the raw material. From their perspective, making it easy to read primary sources is pure downside: • Most readers don't care/have time. • Of the tiny number who do, the chances of them finding a mistake in your reporting or in the primary source is high. • It makes it easier to mis-represent the source to bolster the story.

45108548,45112180,nomoreofthat,14 hours ago,"What condescending nonsense is this? I use all the major LLM systems, mostly with their most expensive models, and when I ask them for sources, including specifically in many cases sources for legal questions, half the time the linked source will not be remotely irrelevant, and will not remotely substantiate the claim that it is being cited for. Almost never is it without an error of some significance. They all still hallucinate very consistently if you’re actually pushing them into areas that are complicated and non-obvious, when they can’t figure out an answer, they make one up. The reduction in apparent hallucinations in a recent models seems to be more that they’ve learned specific cases where they should say they don’t know, not that the problem has been solved in a broader sense. This is true for first party applications, as well as for custom integrations, where I can explicitly check that the context should be grounding them with all of the relevant facts. It doesn’t matter, that isn’t enough, you can tell me I’m holding it wrong, but we’ve consulted with experts from anthropic and from OpenAI and who have done major AI integrations at some of the most prominent AI consuming companies. I’m not holding it wrong. It’s just a horribly flawed piece of technology that must be used with extreme thoughtfulness if you want to do anything non-trivial without massive risks. I remain convinced that the people who can’t see the massive flaws in current LLM systems must be negligently incompetent in how they perform their jobs. I use LLM’s every day in my work and they are a great help to my productivity, but learning to use them effectively is all about understanding the countless ways in which they fail and thinks that they cannot be relied on for and understanding where they actually provide value. They do provide value for me in legal research, because sometimes they point me in the direction of caselaw or legal considerations that hadn’t occurred to me. But the majority of the time, the vast majority, their summaries are incorrect, and their arguments are invalid. LLMs are not capable of reasoning which requires non-obvious jumps of logic which are more than one small step removed from the example that they’ve seen in their training. If you attempt to use them to reason about a legal situation, you will immediately see themselves tie themselves in not because they are not capable of that kind of reasoning, on top of their inability to actually understand in summarize case documents and statutes accurately. reply",Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts,colesantiago,2025-09-02 20:26:47,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html,831,572

Where do you think LLMs learned this behavior from? Go spend time in the academic literature outside of computer science and you will find an endless sea of material with BS citations that don't substantiate the claim being made, entirely made up claims with no evidence, citations of retracted papers, nonsensical numbers etc. And that's when papers take months to write and have numerous coauthors, peer reviewers and editors involved (theoretically). Now read some newspapers or magazines and it's the same except the citations are gone.

45108548,45113026,grues-dinner,11 hours ago,"The problem I may have with using an LLM for this is that I am not already familiar with the subject in detail and won't know when the thing has: * Strayed from reality * Strayed from the document and is freely admixing with other information from its training data without saying so. Done properly, this is a powerful tool for synthesis, and LLMs theoretically are great at it, but done improperly it just muddles things * Has some kind of bias baked in-ironic mdash-""in summary, this ruling is an example of judicial overreach by activist judges against a tech company which should morally be allowed to do what they want"". Not such a problem now, but I think we may see more of this once AI is firmly embedded into every information flow. Currently the AI company game is training people to trust the machine. Once they do, what a resource those people become! Now, none of those points are unique to LLMs: inaccuracy, misunderstanding, wrong or confused synthesis and especially bias are all common in human journalism. Gell-Mann amnesia and institutional bias and all that. Perhaps the problem is that I'm not sufficiently mistrustful of the status quo, even though I am already quite suspicious of journalistic analysis. Or maybe it's because AI, though my brain screams ""don't trust it, check everything, find the source"", remains in the toolbox even when I find problems, whereas for a journalist I'd roll my eyes, call them a hack and leave the website. Not that it's directly relevant to the immediate utility of AI today, but once AI is everything, or almost everything, then my next worry is what happens when you functionally only have published primary material and AI output to train on. Even without model collapse, what happens when AI journobots inherently don't ""pick up the phone"", so to speak, to dig up details? For the first year, the media runs almost for free. For the second year, there's no higher level synthesis for the past year to lean on and it all regresses to summarising press releases. Again, there are already many human publications that just repackage PRs, but when that's all there is?

45108548,45111538,Workaccount2,16 hours ago,"""Based on the court's memorandum opinion in the case of United States v. Google LLC, Google is required to adhere to a series of remedies aimed at curbing its monopolistic practices in the search and search advertising markets. These remedies address Google's distribution agreements, data sharing, and advertising practices. Distribution Agreements A central component of the remedies focuses on Google's distribution agreements to ensure they are not shutting out competitors: No Exclusive Contracts Google is barred from entering into or maintaining exclusive contracts for the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and the Gemini app. No Tying Arrangements Google cannot condition the licensing of the Play Store or any other Google application on the preloading or placement of its other products like Search or Chrome. Revenue Sharing Conditions The company is prohibited from conditioning revenue-sharing payments on the exclusive placement of its applications. Partner Freedom Distribution partners are now free to simultaneously distribute competing general search engines (GSEs), browsers, or generative AI products. Contract Duration Agreements with browser developers, OEMs, and wireless carriers for default placement of Google products are limited to a one-year term. Data Sharing and Syndication To address the competitive advantages Google gained through its exclusionary conduct, the court has ordered the following: Search Data Access Google must provide ""Qualified Competitors"" with access to certain search index and user-interaction data to help them improve their services. This does not, however, include advertising data. Syndication Services Google is required to offer search and search text ad syndication services to qualified competitors on ordinary commercial terms. This will enable smaller firms to provide high-quality search results and ads while they build out their own capabilities. Advertising Transparency To promote greater transparency in the search advertising market, the court has mandated that: Public Disclosure Google must publicly disclose significant changes to its ad auction processes. This is intended to prevent Google from secretly adjusting its ad auctions to increase prices. What Google is NOT Required to Do The court also specified several remedies it would not impose: No Divestiture Google is not required to sell off its Chrome browser or the Android operating system. No Payment Ban Google can continue to make payments to distribution partners for the preloading or placement of its products. The court reasoned that a ban could harm these partners and consumers. No Choice Screens The court will not force Google to present users with choice screens on its products or on Android devices, citing a desire to avoid dictating product design. No Sharing of Granular Ad Data Google is not required to share detailed, query-level advertising data with advertisers. A ""Technical Committee"" will be established to assist in implementing and enforcing the final judgment, which will be in effect for six years."" Frankly I don't think that's bad at all.

(I cancelled because I bought a product they gave a positive review for, only to find out they had flat-out lied about its features, and it was painfully obvious in retrospect that the company paid Ars for a positive review. Or they’re so bad at their jobs they let clearly wrong information into their review… I’m not sure which is worse.) reply",Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts,colesantiago,2025-09-02 20:26:47,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html,831,572

There is one reason why I resort to using AI, and two reasons why I always double check its answers. The reason why I resort to AI is to find out alternative solutions quickly. But quite honestly, it's more of a problem with SO moderation. People are willing to answer even stale, actual/mistaken duplicate or slightly/seemingly irrelevant questions with good quality solutions and alternatives. But I always felt that their moderation dissuaded the contributors from it. Meanwhile, the first reason why I always double check the AI results is because they hallucinate way too much. They fake completely believable answers far too often. The second reason is that AI often neglects interesting/relevant extra information that humans always recognize as important. This is very evident if you read elaborate SO answers or official documentation like MDN, docs.rs or archwiki. One particular example for this is the XY-problem. People seem to make similar mistaken assumptions and SO answers are very good at catching those. Recipe-book/cookbook documentation also address these situations well.

I swear in the past week alone things that would've taken me weeks to do are taking hours. Some examples: create a map with some callouts on it based on a pre-existing design (I literally would've needed several hours of professional or at least solid amateur design work to do this in the past; took 10 minutes with ChatGPT). Figure out how much a rooftop solar system's output would be compromised based on the shading of a roof at a specific address at different times of the day (a task I literally couldn't have completed on my own). Structural load calculations for a post in a house (another one I couldn't have completed on my own). Note some of these things can't be wrong so of course you can't blindly rely on ChatGPT, but every step of the way I'm actually taking any suspicious-sounding ChatGPT output and (ironically I guess) running keyword searches on Google to make sure I understand what exactly ChatGPT is saying. But we're talking orders of magnitude less time, less searching and less cost to do these things. Edit: not to say that the judge's ruling in this case is right.

And it's not even close, really.  People are so set in their positions here that they've stopped even attempting to survey the market those opinions are about.

45108548,45111741,glenstein,16 hours ago,"Like others have noted, I think it's far from obvious that Google's LLM prompt is the best experience in the space, I would say it's clearly not in the top tier and even that relatively speaking, I consider it bad compared to the best options. Assuming we're talking about the AI generated blurbs at the top of search results, there are loads of problems. For one they frequently don't load at all. For another search is an awkward place for them to be. I interact with search differently than with a chat interface where you're embedding a query in a kind of conversational context such that both your query and the answer are rich in contextual meaning. With search I'm typically more fact finding and in a fight against Google's page rank optimizations to try and break through to get my information I need. In a search context AI prompts don't benefit from context rich prompts and aren't able to give context-rich answers and kind of give generic background that isn't necessarily what I asked for. To really benefit from the search prompts I would have to be using the search bar in a prompt way, which would likely degrade the search results. And generally this hybrid interaction is not very natural or easy to optimize, and we all know nobody is asking for it, it's just bolted on to neutralize the temptation to leave search behind in favor of an LLM chat. And though less important, material design as applied to Google web sites in the browser is not good design, it's ugly and the wrong way to have a prompt interaction. This is also the case for Gemini from a web browser. Meanwhile GPT and Claude are a bit more comfortable with information density and are better visual and interactive experiences because of it. reply",Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts,colesantiago,2025-09-02 20:26:47,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html,831,572

45108548,45111000,socksy,17 hours ago,"What? The Google LLM assisted search experience is... not the best option by a long shot? It's laughably incorrect in many cases, and infuriatingly incorrect in the others. It forces itself into your queries above the fold without being asked, and then bullshits to you. A recentish example, I was trying to remember which cities' buses were in Thessaloniki before they got a new batch recently. They used to rent from a company (Papadakis Bros) that would buy out of commission buses from other cities around the world and maintain the fleet. I could remember specifically that there were some BVG Busses from Berlin, and some Dutch buses, and was vaguely wondering if there were some also from Stockholm I couldn't remember. So I searched on my iPad, which defaulted to Google (since clearly I hadn't got around to setting up a good search engine on it yet). And I get this result: https://i.imgur.com/pm512HU.jpeg The LLM forced its way in there without me prompting (in e.g. Kagi, you opt in by ending the query with a question mark). It fundamentally misunderstands the question. It then treats me like an idiot for not understanding that Stockholm is a city in Sweden, and Thessaloniki a city in Greece. It uses its back linking functionality to help cite this great insight. And it takes up the entire page! There's not a single search result in view. This is such a painful experience, it confirms my existing bias that since they introduced LLMs (and honestly for a couple years before that) that Google is no longer a good first place to go for information. It's more of a last resort. Both ChatGPT and Claude have a free tier, and the ability to do searches. Here's what ChatGPT gave me: https://chatgpt.com/share/68b78eb7-d7b4-8006-81e0-ab2c548931... A lot of casual users don't hit the free tier limits (and indeed I've not hit any limits on the free ChatGPT yet), and while they have their problems they're both far better than the Gemini powered summaries Google have been pumping out.

I mean... your phrasing was 100% ambiguous!  There's no such thing as a ""Stockholm bus"", or ""Stockholm rolling stock"". There are buses in Stockholm, and buses in Thessoloniki, and buses manufactured in Sweden, and buses previously used in Stockholm that are now in operation in Thessoloniki.  And one LLM took one path through the question, answering it correctly and completely.  And the other took a different one[1].  As it happened your (poorly phrased) intended question was answered by one and not the other. If I ask the same question with a more careful phrasing that (I think!) matches what you wanted to know: ""Where did buses used in Thessoloniki come from originally?"" ...I get correct and clear answers from both.  But the Google result also has the Wikipedia page for the transit operator and its own web page immediately to the right. Again, cherry picking notwithstanding I think in general the integrated experience of ""I need an AI to help me with this problem"" works much better at google.com, it just does. [1] It's worth pointing out that the result actually told you that your question didn't make sense , and why.

And similarly with Chrome; it made no sense to bring Chrome into this equation. Google started, developed, and built Chrome into the best browser available today NOT through exclusive contracts, but because Chrome is just a better product. Users can switch to Firefox/Safari (Mac default)/Edge (Windows default); they don't because Chrome is better. Forcing Google to give up one of its best products is effectively eminent domain by the government to a private company. With the rise of ChatGPT (I barely use Google anymore) and AI search engines potentially shifting the search landscape, who knows if Google will still be a monopoly 5 years from now. Software moves fast and the best solution to software monopoly is more software competition. reply",Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts,colesantiago,2025-09-02 20:26:47,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html,831,572

Once a company has monopoly power of any kind, it is useless to try to stop  it from using that power to do certain things.  It will always find a way to use its power to get around any restrictions.  The problem isn't what the monopoly does, it's that the monopoly exists.

When users run an internet search, Google gives Apple a significant cut of the advertising revenue that an iPhone user’s searches generate. > 16. Apple wraps itself in a cloak of privacy, security, and consumer preferences to justify its anticompetitive conduct. Indeed, it spends billions on marketing and branding to promote the self-serving premise that only Apple can safeguard consumers’ privacy and security interests. Apple selectively compromises privacy and security interests when doing so is in Apple’s own financial interest—such as degrading the security of text messages, offering governments and certain companies the chance to access more private and secure versions of app stores, or accepting billions of dollars each year for choosing Google as its default search engine when more private options are available. In the end, Apple deploys privacy and security justifications as an elastic shield that can stretch or contract to serve Apple’s financial and business interests. > 145. Similarly, Apple is willing to sacrifice user privacy and security in other ways so long as doing so benefits Apple.

The data underlying Glue consists of information relating to (1) the query, such as its text, language, user location, and user device type; (2) ranking information, including the 10 blue links and any other triggered search features that appear on the SERP, such as images, maps, Knowledge Panel, People also ask, etc.; (3) SERP interaction information, such as clicks, hovers, and duration on the SERP; and (4) query interpretation and suggestions, including spelling correction and salient query terms.

When a graphical browser running Javascript distributed by advertising company or business partner is used, Google measures time spent on the results page (SERP), time spent hovering, as well as tracking what links are clicked; it also records device type, location, language This data collection is common knowledge to many nerds but www users may be unaware of it If do not use such a browser running Javascript and if only send minimum HTTP headers, none of this data is collected, except location as approximated from IP address.  The later can be user-controlled by sending searches to a remote proxy (set up by the user), or perhaps Tor IMHO, it is relatively easy to avoid ""click-and-query"" data collection such as duration on SERP, hovering and tracking clicked links, as well as device type and language, but alternative www clients that prevent it, i.e., not the browser distributed by Google, are not made available as a choice.
