During that time my Gandi account with a decade-old domain name got locked. I have been emailing back and fourth with their Abuse department for the better part of a week and they\u2019re slow-walking me at best.<p>I had assurances from the CEO, who I reached via text, that if it wasn\u2019t resolved today to text him back. He has now gone dark on me.<p>I used to love Gandi, but they\u2019re holding my domain name hostage. This doesn\u2019t sound awful until I mention that the nameservers were changed when the account got locked, so I have no access to the domain whatsoever. This isn\u2019t just a domain I\u2019ve done nothing with, but it has my entire life attached to it.<p>I know they went downhill since they were acquired, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be this bad, obviously.<p>What can I do?
