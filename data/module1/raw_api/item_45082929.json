I&#x27;ve built a similar tool in JavaScript before so I thought porting it would be a great learning exercise.<p>This was a dive into Go&#x27;s basics for me, from package structure and CLI flag parsing to building binaries for different platforms (never did that on my JS projects).<p>I&#x27;m starting to understand why Go is so praised: it&#x27;s standard library is huge compared with other languages. One thing that really impressed me was the idea (at some point of this journey) to develop a functionality by myself (where in the javascript original project I choose to use an external library), here with the opportunities that std lib was giving me I thought &quot;why don&#x27;t try to create the function by miself?&quot; and it worked! In the Js version I used the nodejs &quot;log-update&quot;, here I write a dedicated pkg.<p>I know it&#x27;s a bit silly, but I could see it being used to add some fun to build scripts or idk highlight important log messages, or just make a colleague smile. It&#x27;s easy to install if you have Go set up:<p><pre><code>  go install github.com&#x2F;fsgreco&#x2F;go-bunny-sign&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;bunnysign@latest\n</code></pre>\nSince I&#x27;m new to Go, I would genuinely appreciate any feedback on the code, project structure, or Go best practices. The README also lists my planned next steps, like adding tests and setting up CI better.<p>Thanks for taking a look!", "time": 1756646172, "title": "Show HN: My first Go project, a useless animated bunny sign for your terminal", "type": "story", "url": "https://github.com/fsgreco/go-bunny-sign"}
